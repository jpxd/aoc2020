# Advent of Code 2020

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020) puzzles of 2020 written in Rust. It's my first time using Rust, so expect nothing too fancy.

# Usage

Rust has to be installed (e.g. via [rustup](https://rustup.rs)). The solutions are located in `src/bin` and can be executed from the project root directory via cargo (e.g. run `cargo run --bin day1` or for an optimized version run `cargo run --release --bin day1`).
